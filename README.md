# Dual-Servo-Tilt-Plate
Dual servo tilt plate

STL's & code for a dual servo (DSSERVO DS3225MG 25KG) tilt plate mechanism.
All bolts are M3, bearings are 3mm ID, 9mm OD & 5mm thick. The bearing holes are 9.3mm to take account of the thermal expansion of PLA (you may need to adjust this.
The rose baerings (rod connectors) are all M3 as are the threaded rods.

The code should run on any Arduino hooked upto an Adafruit_PWMServoDriver board (I2C)
The PC side serial controller is a basic TK slider GUI. Python 3.x & needs PySerial.
